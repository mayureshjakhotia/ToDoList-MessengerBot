Bot is live on https://www.facebook.com/MJ-Test-Bot-1449363222029983/
(To be added as a tester, ping me on the above link with your Facebook ID)

Technologies: Python, Postgresql, SQLAlchemy, Messenger, Heroku.

Functionality:

1. In order to add a list, you can use the format "ADD <SPACE> List Description" to add to the to-do list.
2. Using "LIST" would list all the lists added now.
3. Change status to DONE using the "#Listno. DONE".
4. Type "List Done" to see your recent lists which were marked DONE".
5. Type "#Listno. DELETE" to delete a list."
6. Change status to UNDONE using the "#Listno. UNDO".


Future Enhancements:

1. Natural language queries such as 'delete the list number 3', or 'list me all the done lists' could be implemented.
2. Appropriate routes in case of testing from web browser for all lists etc. using a REST API format.

(Includes various commented portions kept in order to reuse it if needed in future.)
